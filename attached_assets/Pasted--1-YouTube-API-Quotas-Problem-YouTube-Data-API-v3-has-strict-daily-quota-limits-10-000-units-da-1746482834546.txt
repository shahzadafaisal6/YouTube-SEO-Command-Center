üîß 1. YouTube API Quotas
Problem: YouTube Data API v3 has strict daily quota limits (10,000 units/day by default), and some requests (e.g., videos.list) are more expensive (1‚Äì100 units each).

Solution Plan:

Minimize Calls: Only fetch data when absolutely necessary (e.g., not on every page refresh).

Batch Requests: Use videos.list?id=... with multiple IDs in one call.

Quota Monitoring: Add real-time quota tracking in your admin dashboard.

Upgrade Strategy: Set up a plan to request quota increases from Google (requires usage justification).

Fallback Handling: Gracefully handle quota exhaustion with user-friendly error messages.

üîê 2. Authentication (Google OAuth)
Problem: Users may want to track their own videos, access private analytics, or save preferences.

Solution Plan:

OAuth 2.0 via Google Identity Services: Enables secure login using Google accounts.

Scopes: Request read-only access (https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.readonly) unless you plan to modify data.

Session Management: Use JWT for secure session tokens, and store user data in PostgreSQL.

Authorization Middleware: Protect backend routes so only logged-in users can access private video tracking features.

‚öôÔ∏è 3. Caching & Rate Limiting
Problem: Repeated API calls can be expensive and slow down the app.

Solution Plan:

Cache Results:

Use Redis or in-memory caching for popular keywords or video metrics.

Set TTL (Time-to-Live) for freshness‚Äîe.g., 6 hours for ranking data.

Rate Limiting:

Use middleware (e.g., express-rate-limit) to limit user requests.

Throttle backend API usage per user/IP.

Queue System (Optional): Add a task queue (e.g., BullMQ) to defer non-critical API calls.

ü§ñ 4. AI Integration Planning
Problem: AI features can be powerful but require clear scoping to avoid scope creep and high compute costs.

Solution Plan:

Phase 1 AI (MVP):

Use OpenAI API to suggest optimized titles/descriptions based on keyword input and video context.

Example: "Improve this title for SEO: [title]"

Phase 2 AI (Future):

Content analysis: Pull transcripts from videos and analyze successful competitor content.

Predictive optimization: Suggest upload times, hashtags, thumbnail suggestions.

UI Integration:

Add AI buttons like ‚ÄúGenerate Title‚Äù or ‚ÄúImprove Description.‚Äù

Cost Control: Use token limits and batching to keep API costs manageable.
